//Question  =>
//Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax. Also, make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.


//code =>

// so basically this tutorial is about "ARROW" functions
// if there is " () => " then its a arrow function / anonymous functions
// And if we don't have a function body (only something to return) we can omit the "return" keyword & {} brackets.


const magic = () =>  new Date();
